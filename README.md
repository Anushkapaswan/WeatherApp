# WeatherApp

A simple **Weather Forecast Web Application** built with Node.js backend and a frontend to display current weather data for a given city or the user’s current location.

## Features

- Search weather by **city name** or use **geolocation** (if the user allows)  
- Display key weather data: temperature, humidity, wind speed, “feels like” temperature, weather description, etc.  
- Clean, responsive UI for desktop and mobile  
- Node.js backend (API layer) to fetch and serve weather data  
- Uses a free weather‑data API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap)  
- Additional polish: environment variable for API key, error handling, .gitignore, etc.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (or whichever you used)  
- **API**: OpenWeatherMap (or whichever you used)  
- **Version Control**: Git + GitHub  
- **Other Tools**: (Add if you used) e.g., dotenv for environment variables, axios or fetch for HTTP requests, etc.
